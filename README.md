## About

[OpenFGA](https://openfga.dev) is an open source Fine-Grained Authorization solution inspired by [Google's Zanzibar paper](https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/). It was created by the FGA team at [Auth0](https://auth0.com) based on [Auth0 Fine-Grained Authorization (FGA)](https://fga.dev), available under [a permissive license (Apache-2)](https://github.com/openfga/rfcs/blob/main/LICENSE) and welcomes community contributions.

OpenFGA is designed to make it easy for application builders to model their permission layer, and to add and integrate fine-grained authorization into their applications. OpenFGAâ€™s design is optimized for reliability and low latency at a high scale.

## Installation

## Getting Started

### Initializing the API Client

[Learn how to initialize your SDK](https://openfga.dev/docs/getting-started/setup-sdk-client)

> The SdkClient will by default retry API requests up to 15 times on 429 and 5xx errors.

#### No Credentials

```java
```

#### API Token

```java
```

#### Client Credentials

```java
```


### Get your Store ID

You need your store id to call the OpenFGA API (unless it is to call the [CreateStore](#create-store) or [ListStores](#list-stores) methods).

If your server is configured with [authentication enabled](https://openfga.dev/docs/getting-started/setup-openfga#configuring-authentication), you also need to have your credentials ready.

### Calling the API

#### Stores

##### List Stores

Get a paginated list of stores.

[API Documentation](https://openfga.dev/api/service/docs/api#/Stores/ListStores)

```java
```

##### Create Store

Initialize a store.

[API Documentation](https://openfga.dev/api/service/docs/api#/Stores/CreateStore)

```java
```

##### Get Store

Get information about the current store.

[API Documentation](https://openfga.dev/api/service/docs/api#/Stores/GetStore)

> Requires a client initialized with a storeId

```java
```

##### Delete Store

Delete a store.

[API Documentation](https://openfga.dev/api/service/docs/api#/Stores/DeleteStore)

> Requires a client initialized with a storeId

```java
```

#### Authorization Models

##### Read Authorization Models

Read all authorization models in the store.

[API Documentation](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Authorization%20Models/ReadAuthorizationModels)

```java
```

##### Write Authorization Model

Create a new authorization model.

[API Documentation](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Authorization%20Models/WriteAuthorizationModel)

> Note: To learn how to build your authorization model, check the Docs at https://openfga.dev/docs.

> Learn more about [the OpenFGA configuration language](https://openfga.dev/docs/configuration-language).

> You can use the [OpenFGA Syntax Transformer](https://github.com/openfga/syntax-transformer) to convert between the friendly DSL and the JSON authorization model.

```java
```

#### Read a Single Authorization Model

Read a particular authorization model.

[API Documentation](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Authorization%20Models/ReadAuthorizationModel)

```java
```

##### Read the Latest Authorization Model

Reads the latest authorization model (note: this ignores the model id in configuration).

[API Documentation](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Authorization%20Models/ReadAuthorizationModel)

```java
```

#### Relationship Tuples

##### Read Relationship Tuple Changes (Watch)

Reads the list of historical relationship tuple writes and deletes.

[API Documentation](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Relationship%20Tuples/ReadChanges)

```java
```

##### Read Relationship Tuples

Reads the relationship tuples stored in the database. It does not evaluate nor exclude invalid tuples according to the authorization model.

[API Documentation](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Relationship%20Tuples/Read)

```java
```

##### Write (Create and Delete) Relationship Tuples

Create and/or delete relationship tuples to update the system state.

[API Documentation](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Relationship%20Tuples/Write)

###### Transaction mode (default)

By default, write runs in a transaction mode where any invalid operation (deleting a non-existing tuple, creating an existing tuple, one of the tuples was invalid) or a server error will fail the entire operation.

```java
```

Convenience `WriteTuples` and `DeleteTuples` methods are also available.

###### Non-transaction mode

The SDK will split the writes into separate requests and send them sequentially to avoid violating rate limits.

```java
```

#### Relationship Queries

##### Check

Check if a user has a particular relation with an object.

[API Documentation](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Relationship%20Queries/Check)

```java
```

##### Batch Check

Run a set of [checks](#check). Batch Check will return `allowed: false` if it encounters an error, and will return the error in the body.
If 429s or 5xxs are encountered, the underlying check will retry up to 15 times before giving up.

```java
```

##### Expand

Expands the relationships in userset tree format.

[API Documentation](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Relationship%20Queries/Expand)

```java
```

#### List Objects

List the objects of a particular type a user has access to.

[API Documentation](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Relationship%20Queries/ListObjects)

```java
```

#### List Relations

List the relations a user has on an object.

```java
```

### Assertions

#### Read Assertions

Read assertions for a particular authorization model.

[API Documentation](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Assertions/Read%20Assertions)

```java
```

#### Write Assertions

Update the assertions for a particular authorization model.

[API Documentation](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Assertions/Write%20Assertions)

```java
```
